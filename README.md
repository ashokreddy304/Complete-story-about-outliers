# Outlier Analysis in Data

Welcome to the Outlier Analysis repository! This project demonstrates how to identify, analyze, and handle outliers in datasets using practical, real-world examples. Outliers can distort insights and impact model performance, so understanding them is crucial in data analysis and machine learning.

## Features
- Identification of outliers using statistical methods (Z-score, IQR)
- Visualization techniques to detect outliers (boxplots, scatterplots)
- Handling outliers via removal, capping, and transformation
- Practical examples with sample datasets
- Insights into improving data quality and model accuracy

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/outlier-analysis.git
